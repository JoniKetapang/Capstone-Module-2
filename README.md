Supermarket Data Analysis (Simulated Project)

Background

OmegaMart is a supermarket that is in a dire need of a new discount strategy. Their shopping paradigms encompass a diverse array including a physical storefront, an electronic commerce portal, as well as a catalog-based retail outlet, thus providing a multifaceted platform for their clientele.

This individual, armed with statistical acumen, is entrusted with the critical task of deciphering the complex data acquired over the preceding biennium. Their objective is to provide a solid foundation for the strategic design of OmegaMart's forthcoming discount initiatives.
